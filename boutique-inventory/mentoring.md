# Mentoring on Boutique Inventory

## Iteration 2 submitted (5 Mar 2024)

The `total_stock` method seemed quite laborious to work out, and the pointers ChatGPT gave me led me away from the methods given in the initial exercise text.

I understand how I've got `total_stock` working now, but is there a way that more closely corresponds to the methods provided in the exercise text?

Hey,

Your code seems pretty good, but there are some possible upgrades.

1. `out_of_stock` -> try to use `none?` or `empty?` method.
1. `stock_for_item` -> Check out `.find` method, that returns first element.
1. `total_stock` -> now I can see you have already solved that in better way!

Good Luck, Pavel
